This README preserves the original README content. The project has been reorganized into `backend/` and `frontend/` directories.

Backend usage (from repository root):

cd backend
npm install
create a local `.env` (see `.env.example`)
node setup-db.js
npm run seed
npm start

Frontend (standalone) is available under `frontend/standalone` or full React app under `frontend/`.
